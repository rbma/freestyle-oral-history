Sometimes called Latin hip hop, Latin freestyle or Heartthrob, its Roland bass, effervescent minor-key synth melodies, and Latin-influenced syncopation infected urban teenagers from New York to Miami to Chicago to L.A. Its lyrics were the perfect soundtrack to tormented high school romances while the sounds of whips, laser beams, machine-gun stutters and pitch-shifted vocals explored the limits of the new electronic beat machines. Freestyle songs said one thing: regardless of how heartbroken or lovesick you might be, you better get out on the dancefloor.</p><p>The backbone of freestyle was the work of electro godfather <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlyDSx8gpZ0" target=_blank>Arthur Baker and John Robie</a> on hits like Afrika Bambaataa’s “Planet Rock” (and its sister “Play At Your Own Risk” by Planet Patrol), Freeez’s “I.O.U.,” and C-Bank’s “One More Shot.” Many of freestyle’s greatest producers and DJs would work in Baker’s hit factory editing or mixing, including Shep Pettibone, Aldo Marin, <a href=http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/newyork-masters-at-work target=_blank>Louie Vega</a>, Andy Panda, Carlos Berrios and the <a href=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2015/04/revolutions-on-air-film>Latin Rascals</a> (Albert Cabrera and Tony Moran). Some of these DJs would also helm popular mix shows on WKTU, Kiss-100 and Hot 103 in New York City, bringing the sounds from the clubs to the tape decks and block parties of the five boroughs.</p><p>Following the July 1983 release of Shannon’s dramatic “Let the Music Play” in NYC and several hits from Miami’s “Pretty Tony” Butler – including Debbie Deb’s “When I Hear Music” and Freestyle’s “Freestyle Express” – the stage was set for a furiously fertile period where freestyle hits were being made, club-tested and released on independent labels in a matter of weeks. But freestyle really began to pull away from its breakdance roots and crystallize into its own genre with the addition of teen frontwomen like Nayobe, Lisa Lisa and Trinere – themselves plucked from high schools and behind the counters at clothing stores and catapulted into underground fame. Sung, written and produced largely by second-generation Latinos, freestyle captured the imagination of young clubgoers who could finally see and hear themselves reflected in the music.</p><p>By the dawn of the ’90s, thousands of freestyle songs had been cranked out and the formula was wearing thin, replaced by the harder-edged crackle ‘n’ pop of ’90s dance and full-blown fever for the new jack hip hop and R&amp;B of groups like Naughty by Nature and TLC. The genre would become a joke in the industry, even as millions of fans from the Bronx to Brazil kept the torch aflame. Ultimately, a series of reunion concerts and arena shows starting in the early 2000s resuscitated the careers of Cover Girls, Judy Torres, Exposé and Debbie Deb, among others.</p><p>Freestyle is the story of teen dreams – a time when young producers, vocalists, DJs, and label owners conspired to remake pop in their own image. Against the backdrop of a battered (but permissive) New York City and the glamorous warzone of <em>Miami Vice</em>-era Florida, a rag-tag group of heartthrobs proved that all that glittered could be (pop) gold, creating songs that continue to inspire the likes of <a href=http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/mia-makin-it-appen target=_blank>M.I.A.</a>, Janet Jackson, <a href=http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/morgan-geist-environmental-activist target=_blank>Morgan Geist</a> and Blood Orange, among many others. In this oral history, Vivian Host cruises with some of the men and women behind those perfect beats.</p></div></div><div rbma-quote-block id=body-1 block=block class="block block-quote size-medium alignment-left ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-class=paramsClasses><blockquote><div ng-bind-html="block.text | markdown" class=ng-binding><p><strong>Arthur Baker</strong><br>Legendary hitmaker and godfather of electro-hip hop</p></div></blockquote></div><div rbma-text-block id=body-2 block=block class="block block-text style-normal ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-class=paramsClasses><div bind-compiled-html="block.text | markdown"><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Arthur Baker</p><p>Freestyle was literally music for New York.

At the time there was no freestyle. Dance music wasn’t even taken seriously. Lisa Lisa and Planet Patrol weren’t out yet, but Afrika Bambaataa was. “Let the Music Play” is influenced by all of those flavors, but it’s more Latin, Cuban, African. By ‘84/’85, “Let the Music Play” was huge and topping the worldwide charts. <em>Billboard</em> was calling it the “Shannon sound.” It went on to sell more than ten million worldwide.</p></div></div><div rbma-quote-block id=body-8 block=block class="block block-quote size-medium alignment-right ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-class=paramsClasses><blockquote><div ng-bind-html="block.text | markdown" class=ng-binding><p><strong>Chris Barbosa</strong><br>Bronx-born DJ/producer who worked closely with Mark Liggett to produce Shannon and other freestyle hits</p></div></blockquote></div><div rbma-text-block id=body-9 block=block class="block block-text style-normal ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-class=paramsClasses><div bind-compiled-html="block.text | markdown"><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Chris Barbosa</p><p>I think that came from just growing up Puerto Rican banging sticks to Latin salsa music, plus always listening to pop music growing up in the ‘70s. I was homesick for a while and I started messing around and that’s how ““Fire and Ice” – which was the original version of “Let The Music Play” – came about. The “fire” is the street bass and the beat and the “ice” is the pop melody that sits on top... A friend of Mark’s named Quentin Hicks then said he knew a girl who might sound good on it.

The Fever was getting ready to get closed up for no cabaret license and I didn’t know what to do with my future. Hip hop had blown up and The Fever got all old and played out. I’m sitting in this park and I start watching these Puerto Rican kids breakdancing. I thought, “Oh shit! Latin hip hop!” There was no freestyle music or anything yet, but I was going by the culture and the movement. My father happened to have a Latin club that I was helping him promote, which was in the Bronx not too far from The Fever. I called him and said, “Yo, I found a new movement: Latin hip hop.” My dad said, “Forget about hip hop. I don’t want to deal with hip hop no more.”</p><p>At the same time, this is 1984, I had this young lady, a Cuban named Nayobe. She was 15 but she wound up winning my <em>Gong Show</em> at The Fever; the prize was a recording contract with Fever Records. I was trying to figure out what I was going to do with her. At the same time, there was this young Puerto Rican named Andy Tripoli, AKA Andy Panda, who worked in a record store in the city called Downtown Records with Tony Moran of Latin Rascals. They were two young aspiring DJs.</p></div></div><div rbma-quote-block id=body-14 block=block class="block block-quote size-medium alignment-left ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-class=paramsClasses><blockquote><div ng-bind-html="block.text | markdown" class=ng-binding><p><strong>Tony Moran</strong><br>Legendary hitmaker and godfather of electro-hip-hop</p></div></blockquote></div><div rbma-text-block id=body-15 block=block class="block block-text style-normal ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-class=paramsClasses><div bind-compiled-html="block.text | markdown"><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Tony Moran</p><p>There was Downtown Records, Vinyl Mania and another store that sold to the A-list of DJs of that era, the guys who played in Bonds or <a href=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2014/04/larry-levan-feature>Paradise Garage</a> or <a href=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2015/07/nightclubbing-the-saint>The Saint</a>. I started working at Downtown in exchange for records and that’s how I met Carlos De Jesus, program director of WKTU.</p><p>Carlos heard one of the tapes I made with Albert Cabrera, put it on reel-to-reel and within our first play on the radio, they wound up getting so many requests for it, they played it like 45 times in a row. They dubbed us the Latin Rascals.</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Sal Abbatiello</p><p>Andy Panda, who was about 18, had made a four-track demo in his house of this song called “Please Don’t Go.” He wanted to meet me, and he heard The Fever crew was going to be at this block party in the city. He sees Nayobe sing and I don’t know how, but he gets his way backstage to tell me that he’s got this song that’s going to fit her.</p><p>I take them all back to The Fever. It’s a Sunday night. I play the song for all the rappers and they’re going, “Wow, that shit sounds hot!” At this point, disco had just died. A lot of the hip hop groups were starting to get a few Latins in ‘em: Fearless Four had Tito, Charlie Chase was in Cold Crush Brothers. They’re all over the beat, right? Now Gloria Estefan comes out with a song called “Conga.” When I heard Conga, I’m like, “Wow! A salsa group just made a record in English with a Latin flavor.” I could see the writing on the wall. This time I’m going to make the record, I’m going to get it in the clubs, everything.</p><p>I grab Andy and Nayobe and I go to this record company who I had just signed a deal with to distribute Fever Records and I told them I wanted to my first record to be “Please Don’t Go.” Now they’re looking at me like I’m crazy, like “These kids never been in a studio! He’s never produced a song!” I knew in my heart that that record was a hit. I put them in the studio with an engineer who was very experienced and he taught Andy.</p><p>As Nayobe’s record is blowing up, there was another young girl, a Puerto Rican girl from Hell’s Kitchen, named Lisa Lisa. She was a Latin artist but her record, “I Wonder If I Take You Home,” had a slight R&amp;B touch to it because it was produced by Full Force. The movement was starting.</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Kayel</p><p>Shannon was the mother of freestyle, but Lisa Lisa is like the big sister. When you heard “Can You Feel the Beat” and it had those hard, loud drum loops that we loved from Simple Minds records that defined it. Lisa was the curve that changed the rhythms from the same “Planet Rock” beat progression to a more sample-based beat progression.</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Lisa Lisa</p><p>I’m the youngest of ten and we had a single mother, so we all had to take care of each other. Growing up in Hell’s Kitchen was an adventure for me because it was in the midst of all the Westies (the Irish Mafia) and the Italian Mafia coming in and trying to overtake them. A lot of my friends that I grew up with, their fathers were involved in that. As I grew, the neighborhood started to get very touristy because they started putting in little nightclubs and bar/restaurants with live bands. So at the age of 12 or 13, I was sneaking out of the house, going to these little bars and dressing up in the bathroom and asking them if I could sing.</p><p>I was invited to go and meet up with Full Force, [my producers], through a friend of mine, Mike Hughes, who was a roadie for them. We used to hang out at The Funhouse all the time. I was told that was where Madonna got discovered and I wanted to be discovered too. Mike said, “You need to come to this audition.” I skipped school to go and I didn’t get to audition until close to midnight. Girl, I was scared shitless! I’m from Manhattan, and now I was in Brooklyn, in the basement of a house where they had everything set up. I saw [the guys from Full Force] walk in – there’s six of them and they were huge – and I was the last girl [to audition] so I was by myself. I thought to myself, “I’m gonna get gang raped,” but they were very nice and they really liked me. I sang a couple of songs for them and they recorded me on a cassette. That following Tuesday I was in the studio with them recording “I Wonder If I Take You Home.”</p><p>Our song was released on a compilation overseas called <em>Breakdancing</em> but it took about nine or ten months for the song to be re-released by Columbia in the States. I was still in high school and working my little part-time job. I was behind the register folding clothes at Benetton when my girlfriend called me on the phone and goes, “Girl, you need to put the radio on.” They were playing my song. I was so excited I broke the phone because I threw it across the room!</p></div></div><div rbma-quote-block id=body-16 block=block class="block block-quote size-medium alignment-left ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-class=paramsClasses><blockquote><div ng-bind-html="block.text | markdown" class=ng-binding><p><strong>Oscar G</strong><br>Half of famed Miami house duo Murk</p></div></blockquote></div><div rbma-text-block id=body-17 block=block class="block block-text style-normal ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-class=paramsClasses><div bind-compiled-html="block.text | markdown"><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Oscar G</p><p>For me, what introduced the whole freestyle thing was DJs mixing classic b-boy-type and disco dance records in with those new freestyle records.

And then it got picked up in Miami because a lot of people there had family in New York, cousins or whatever. For years I’d come to Miami, turn on the radio and I’d hear “Play at Your Own Risk,” “Cheap Thrills” or “Perfect Beat” literally within 15 minutes. So Miami was really in a time warp, and they were really into that electro beat with the live element.</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Aldo Marin</p><p>The New York sound was definitely bigger drums, harder, stronger, more street-oriented. The Miami sound was a little faster and the percussion was a lot more dominant in the mixes and it worked. I used to love Debbie Deb, Trinere, Expose and all that Lewis Martineé stuff.</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Pretty Tony</p><p>When I was in high school I was DJing different high school parties. The major labels had record pools – they’d give the DJs 20 records and then you give them your feedback. What they noticed is every one I told them was going to be a hit, was a hit. Then they asked me, “Do you think you could make a record that was a hit?” So I went from DJing to producing. I built a studio, found the artists, wrote the songs, engineered the sessions, recorded them, and set up the label, as far as distribution, accounts receivables, payables, promotion, and all that.</p></div></div><div rbma-quote-block id=body-20 block=block class="block block-quote size-medium alignment-right ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-class=paramsClasses><blockquote><div ng-bind-html="block.text | markdown" class=ng-binding><p>For the full story behind the making of “<a href=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2015/09/key-tracks-debbie-deb-when-i-hear-music>When I Hear Music</a>,” click here.</p></div></blockquote></div><div rbma-text-block id=body-21 block=block class="block block-text style-normal ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-class=paramsClasses><div bind-compiled-html="block.text | markdown"><p>At the same time, I was promoting concerts: Luther Vandross, Gap Band, Midnight Star. One day, I went to Peaches Records to give them more tickets. I was working on the music for “When I Hear Music.” There’s a voice I heard coming from behind a wall and it was the exact voice I had been hearing in my head. That was Debbie Deb. I go, “Do you sing?” She goes, “No, dude.” I go, “Do you want to make a record?” She said, “I guess.” I gave her my number and my address and asked her to come to the studio that night.</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Debbie Deb</p><p>Tony played me the music to “When I Hear Music” and said “Do what you want to do, and we’ll record it.” Two days later I went back to the studio, and we recorded it and it just fit hand in glove. I wasn’t looking to be a singer. It was the furthest thing from my mind. I started and finished beauty school while my song was being played every three hours on the radio. People in Miami were freaking out because I was the hairdresser that works at Hair Sensations in Aventura.</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Trinere</p><p>I pretty much fell into meeting Pretty Tony.

I think he thought I was just another pretty girl who couldn’t sing. He had a really funky attitude, the first time I met him and I threw it back at him. I had to prove a point to him. He presented me with “I Know You Love Me,” and I went in the studio and knocked it out of the park. We recorded it the first night.</p><p>That’s all we did after that; we sat around and recorded day and night. Tony had a way with words and melodies and beats. Garfield Baker and Byron Smith of Freestyle wrote pretty much all my lyrics. They would see me and Tony going through situations and pretty much write about my life, so most of the things that you hear about is all real.</p><p>We would all sit together and write together, and come up with beats. If Tony came up with a beat and it didn’t make me dance or give me goosebumps, I’d be like, “I don’t like it. You need to try something else.” He would listen. A lot of times we butted heads over things, but I would sing it the way he wanted. A lot of the ad libs that you hear in the background, Tony came up with. It would always end up the way everybody liked. He just knows what people want to hear.</p><p>Because Tony and I was in a relationship, I loved being with him and being at the studio day and night with him. Any time he didn’t want me at the studio, it was because he’d probably got some other chick up in there. Let me just blast that. You ever notice that no other female singer came out hot from Tony from that camp? Because Trinere was blocking it all. “Who is this girl? OK, she’ll be out of here. You’re going to focus only on me, baby.”</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Pretty Tony</p><p>Trinere and I were dating at the time. If she was pissed off, she would pretend she couldn’t hit certain notes. One night she came in and we were doing ad libs on “I’ll Be All You Ever Need” and I wasn’t really feeling it. I told her to go home and waited until 4:30 in the morning until she was good and asleep, and I called her up and told her she needed to come to the studio and record her part because we were mixing the record tomorrow. She was so pissed. She came over and can you believe she was doing the same thing, acting like she couldn’t hit the note? I kept a Mac-11 under my console.

I go get Little Louie Vega to DJ, just like I found Grandmaster Flash. I bring in Andy Panda, who I just met.

By 1984, I did a party on my own up in the Bronx. The hot record at the time was “Please Don’t Go” by Nayobe. I hired Nayobe for a show and management came with her. They were like, “Wow, look at Louie. He’s got all these people following him.” So Sal said, “We’d love for you to play at this place called The Devil’s Nest.

It was just a bunch of two-by-four plywood all over the place, painted in black and red. They had the biggest speakers I’ve ever seen, propped all over the place.

He would open the trunk and be like, “I’ve got records. What song you want? Pick one.” His trunk was full of half-inch masters he had just done, like reel-to-reel tapes. He did Giggles with us in 1987 and the first Coro album. I’m not sure but Giggles might be the first time Todd ever played samples up and down a keyboard; I remember we were at Power Play and he played the “Love Letter” vocal with the E-mu Emulator.

It was almost like an indie rock look, but done by Latin guys. A lot of us used to wear grey or navy blue peacoats with brooches. It was like the Minneapolis look, with the pins with the chain hanging from them, and a silk paisley shirt buttoned all the way to the top.

While we were recording “No Reason to Cry” in Alvin Molina’s bedroom, if anyone flushed the toilet we had to start over again because there was no way to wipe that sound out.</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Tony Moran</p><p>Latin Rascals became so big all of a sudden. Managers were like, “Dude, you’re selling out places and girls are going crazy! You need to sing on a song!” and I’m like: “I don’t sing, man” and it’s like, “Well, you better fucking sing!” At the time we were working on a project that was a spoof of classical standards, and we wrote a song called “Arabian Knights.” Then we met the amazingly talented Andy Tripoli and he was like, “I could write a song over that.”</p><p>The background singers taught me that if I could sing a note with confidence, then it would be believable. And if it’s believable then I caught you, like in a trap. So I started singing on these records and I couldn’t believe what was happening – you know, like, singing in front of 100,000 people at the World’s Fair. There was no time to be scared.</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Trinere</p><p>Everything was happening so fast; we put out the songs so fast and they all had the same playing power. There was only so much money, because everything was independent, so we didn’t make any videos. Tony was in talks with major record labels, Atlantic Records and Sony and whatever, but it never panned out.</p></div></div><div id=body-54 class="block block-video alignment-right"><div class=video-frame><div class="video-frame__poster has-video-play-button"><div class=fill-container background-image=true style="background-image: url(http://image1.redbull.com/rbx00786/0001/1/300/486/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-15%20at%204.38.27%20PM.71b52734.png);"></div></div><iframe width=560 height=315 data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ICdM7khE1E?modestbranding=1;autohide=1;showinfo=0;rel=0;" frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class=figure__caption bind-compiled-html=block.video.caption|inlinemarkdown><span>Debbie Deb - I'm Searchin' (Mixx-It)</span></div></div><div rbma-text-block id=body-55 block=block class="block block-text style-normal ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-class=paramsClasses><div bind-compiled-html="block.text | markdown"><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Pretty Tony</p><p>In 1986, I went away “on vacation,” so to speak. None of my artists wanted to sing for anybody but me. After I left, the label had all kinds of producers and engineers. Since the real Debbie Deb didn’t want to sing anymore, they got another girl to be called Debbie Deb and they made “I’m Searching.” The guys at the label knew if they put my name on the label, the radio station would play it, so that’s what they did.</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Trinere</p><p>When Tony went into jail, I had major hits at the time. I had to keep things rolling and continue to perform for the next couple years. A lot of music – Latin hip hop – was coming out of New York but I felt like I had to defend and protect the stuff Tony and I had created that was coming out of Miami. I wouldn’t jump on anybody else’s bandwagon and say, “OK, now you can produce me.” I didn’t jump ship that quick.</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">George Lamond</p><p>In the late ’80s we were touring the country. They booked arenas from west to east. We actually had six tour buses. The people you saw at freestyle shows on the East Coast were majority, I would say 80%, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans and Cubans, and then some Italians. Then you would go to the West Coast and you saw like Samoans and Filipinos and a lot of Asians, but thug motherfuckers. There were a lot of second-generation Mexicans that were really educated and spoke like white people. The styles were totally louder than us, the hair was bigger, the makeup was a lot louder. There was a lot of gang stuff that we didn’t have. We had to be very, very careful of what we wore. They would say, “Whatever you guys do, don’t wear no blue today.”</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Lewis Martinée</p><p>Exposé ended up being much bigger in California than Miami. I know that in California they could sell out an arena tour three nights in a row, whereas in Miami we can barely sell a one-off night in a similar-size arena.</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Sal Abbatiello</p><p>All the major labels thought freestyle was like the next hip hop, so they started signing all these groups: Sa-Fire, Cover Girls, Coro, Exposé, Stevie B, Sweet Sensation, except what happened was they didn’t know what to do with them. They were trying to change their sound to pop.</p></div></div><div rbma-quote-block id=body-56 block=block class="block block-quote size-medium alignment-left ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-class=paramsClasses><blockquote><div ng-bind-html="block.text | markdown" class=ng-binding><p>It’s the only area of music where half of the artists were off-note, off-key and no one gave a fuck because the records were selling everywhere.</p></div><footer class="block-quote__source ng-scope" ng-if=block.source><cite class=ng-binding>Oscar G</cite></footer></blockquote></div><div rbma-text-block id=body-57 block=block class="block block-text style-normal ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-class=paramsClasses><div bind-compiled-html="block.text | markdown"><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Kayel</p><p>The most popular producers by the late ‘80s were Tony Moran, Joey Gardner, Carlos Berrios, and Frankie Cutlass. I had gotten together with Frankie Cutlass, and we were trying to see how we could make it feel a little different. We started experimenting with the tambourine, a lot of breakbeats, sampling the Apache and we came up with “Give Your Love to Me,” which introduced a harder sound. Frankie then worked with Carlos Berrios on Lisette Melendez “Together Forever” and “Temptation” for Corina. At the time, New York was going back to loving hip hop again. Big Daddy Kane was coming out and the rap movement was becoming a lot harder. As hip hop changed, we wanted to change.</p><p>A lot of these copycat guys couldn’t copy the sound. If you wanted the sound of Carlos Berrios or Frankie Cutlass, you had to pay them; but then these guys might be too busy – Tony Moran was working with George Michael and Madonna by that time. The scene became so over-saturated with a bad stuff that it almost drowned out the good records that were happening. Imagine if all the greatest hits of Motown were duplicated and sung by people who weren’t as good as The Supremes or The Temptations, In ‘89, there might have been one or two bad records, but by 1990 there were 30 bad ones.</p></div></div><div rbma-text-block id=body-58 block=block class="block block-text style-normal ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-class=paramsClasses><div bind-compiled-html="block.text | markdown"><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Oscar G</p><p>When it comes to the decline of it, there was an over-saturation of vocalists who couldn’t sing. It’s the only area of music where half of the artists were off-note, off-key and no one gave a fuck because the records were selling everywhere. It was a vehicle for young kids from the hood: you take them in the studio, shine them up, put them on tour. Micmac was a classic example. We’d be doing three or four shows a day back then, running around. Collect the money, jump in the fucking limo, go to the next gig. It was crazy. It didn’t matter because the records sold. The culture kept moving along with it. It also became a jumping off platform for Latino kids from all over the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens to get into the music business.</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Judy Torres</p><p>Part of the problem was also the radio stations. Our songs were on Hot 103, the station that broke us, at the time. Our music became so successful that other stations wanted to add it; they began to say things like, “If you perform at our parade, we will play your song.” Then the other station would say, “If you do that parade, we will never play your record again.” We were all so young we didn’t know what to do. Then Hot 103 became Hot 97 and all of a sudden they played strictly hip hop, no freestyle anymore. Others stations in the country copy what New York radio does, so then no one was playing our songs. I was about two weeks away from releasing my second album when that happened and I was crushed.</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Adam Torres</p><p>Sal Abbatiello carried the torch. There were periods from then to now that were dead for freestyle. He tried to keep it alive but clubs wouldn’t book the artists or shows. And then, just like every other genre, things just have a cycle and it started coming back around and now we have these freestyle arena shows and tours with thousands of people.</p><p class="text-speaker ng-scope">Sal Abbatiello</p><p>Freestyle died in ‘93 or ‘94 but what happens now is there’s all the young generation who grew up on it, listening to it from their older brothers and sisters and mothers. The Italians and Puerto Ricans. Now they’re going into their 20s and their parents are in their 40s. The hooks are great; they’re simple and easy.</p><p>It’s all about love. And the artists are still around and in great shape. I had the insight from hip hop to see the future and then years later, in 2003, to reinvent the music I discovered. Now the same people are divorced or they broke up and they got a new boyfriend and that same song they grew up on, they still got that song to reminisce with.<br><br><em>Additional reporting by Bruce
