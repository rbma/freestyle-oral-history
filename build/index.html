</div><div class="body text-layout--left type-sans-serif bg-color-white"><div class="block block-text style-normal"><p>The original Flavor Unit is best known for launching the 
careers of Naughty By Nature and Queen Latifah, but at their 
creative peak, The 45 King’s team of New Jersey MC’s could 
hold their own against the best from Brooklyn, Queens, the 
Bronx and Long Island. Sophisticated lyricists such as Chill 
Rob G, Lakim Shabazz and Latee displayed strong voices and 
even tougher vocabularies, backed by the irresistible horns 
and basslines of The 45 King.</p><p>Unfortunately, much like their more famous contemporaries the Juice Crew, 
it wasn’t long before record label politics, egos and money issues saw 
them splinter, leaving Queen Latifah and her partner Shakim to re-assemble 
the crew into two subsequent incarnations [Roll Wit The Flava in 
1993 and 100% Hater Proof in 2002] and carry on the name as a film and 
television company.
</p><p>In this oral history, many of the crew’s original members 
look back at this hugely creative period.

We went to high school together out here in Jersey City, 
and then they moved to Irvington, and that’s where they 
met Mark [The 45 King]. Mark had just moved to 
Irvington from Queens – he was living in Hollis.
</p></div><div class="block block-text"><p class="text-speaker">Markey Fresh</p><p>I was born and raised in the Bronxdale projects. 
Afrika Bambaataa used to come through there all the time, 
playing his music outside on the basketball court, 
and I just got consumed by that.
</p></div><div class="block block-quote size-medium alignment-right"><blockquote><p><strong>Markey Fresh</strong>
<br>
One of the first MCs to work with 45 King, he released a solo single
on Jive in 1989
</p></blockquote></div><div class="block block-text"><p>We moved to New Jersey when I was about 16. I went to school 
one day and this guy brung a tape in. I was like, “Man, where’d 
you get that from?” He said, “From this guy named Mark. 
He lives around the corner from the school.” I went straight 
over there into the basement, and I was there every day after 
that, because he was the only one in New Jersey playing 
hip hop – everyone else was into house. He would have all the 
breakbeat parts and I would just rhyme over it. I used to 
kill “Impeach The President.” I was the first one down 
in that basement, and after three years that’s when 
everybody else came out of the woodwork, because Mark 
started becoming known.

Dropped an album on 4th & Broadway called <em>The Hitman</em> in 1991.

</p></blockquote></div><div class="block block-text"><p class="text-speaker">Double J</p><p>Me, Apache and Latee – we went to school together. I wasn’t really into writing 
rhymes ‘cos I’m trying to raise a kid real early. When the music wasn’t giving 
me no checks, I’ve still got to put milk on the table and [buy] Pampers. 
So I had to keep living the street life and rhyme every chance I could. 
Meeting with Mark in ‘86, I heard everybody speaking of the basement, 
but when I started out we were in the attic in East Orange. Mark had 
the microphones screwed into the wall, like four mics lined up, and 
everybody used to come up there, rhymin’. We started to make so 
much noise he had to leave. Then we went down to the basement 
where we continued making the noise.
</p></div><div class="block block-quote size-medium alignment-right"><blockquote><p><strong>Lakim Shabazz</strong>
<br>
Righteous MC who released two albums on the Tuff City label.
</p></blockquote></div><div class="block block-text"><p class="text-speaker">Lakim Shabazz</p><p>When I first met Mark it was through this guy Abdul that 
was managing me. He had let Mark hear my demo – it was 
called, “Girly, Girly Girl.” I had actually did a 
Grover Washington [“Mr. Magic”] beat with my mouth, 
I beatboxed the whole beat. This guy I used to hang 
out with named OP used to go up to Mark’s basement. 
Eventually he took me up there and we would sit 
around in 45 King’s basement and watch videos of him 
spinning and Tito from the Fearless Four rhyming. 
I had to be around the 11th grade at this stage. I 
graduated from high school in ‘86, I started hanging 
with Biz [Markie], and around 1988 Biz was working 
on the “Vapors” album [Goin’ Off] and he was telling 
me I need to wait for him. [But] I was an eager beaver 
and I had met 45 King.</p><p class="text-speaker">Markey Fresh</p><p>I met Latee, then he brought in Apache. Then Latifah came down, 
and everybody looked at her as the girl that wanted to be 
on the baseball team, but didn’t think she could hit any 
home runs. But we let her try out, and she killed it! 
She became a member.
</p><p class="text-speaker">Chill Rob G</p><p>I met Latee at a party, he told me he knew this 
guy who did beats and I should come by the crib. 
So I went down there one night, and Mark put a 
beat on and everybody started rhyming and 
they just passed the mic to me and I said a 
couple of rhymes that I had written – I always 
just wrote rhymes just for the hell of it. He 
asked Latee for my phone number and called me 
up like a day later, and was like, “Yo Rob, 
what you were sayin’ in the basement was 
kinda dope. I wanna make the record with you.”

that lived down the block from me, on Stuyvesant Avenue. 
It was there every night when I used to come home from 
work, I’d walk by. One day I caught him outside and I 
said, “Ay, why don’t you sell that to me?” He gave me 
some crazy-ass price, and I said, “Man, I coulda stole 
the shit! The shit’s been out here for weeks. 
I coulda came and took it, and you gonna sell it to 
me for some crazy-ass price? How ‘bout this – 
I give ya 20 dollars and you help me carry it down the block!”</p><p class="text-speaker">Markey Fresh</p><p>I hated that turnstile! When I first went down there, 
it was just a bunch of crates filled with records, 
two turntables and a microphone. That’s all I needed to see.</p><p class="text-speaker">Lakim Shabazz</p><p>He has that same turnstile in his [new] home, 
it leads from the studio to the bathroom. 
Mark is real creative when it comes to that. 
In his living room now, he has a booth that you would 
see in a restaurant that you can sit in and eat. 
When he was living on 43rd Street, his microphone booth 
was an old glass telephone booth. That’s what we recorded in. 
Mark is a technical genius.</p><p class="text-speaker">The 45 King</p><p>Puffy been through that – Biggie, Tupac, Busta. 
Jay-Z been through this turnstile – a lotta people, 
man. Q-Tip used to sit on the turnstile!

throw some music on so we could freestyle. We used to be down 
there for hours, like a golf round. Be down for three or four 
hours straight, freestylin’. Everybody with mad material. 
I don’t think anybody had more verses than me, Chill Rob and 
Lakim. When they said all they could say, we was still 
goin’ back to back. Mark’s still got all them old 
freestyles, he used video some of them! 
He don’t throw nothing away.
</p></div><div class="block block-text"><h2 id="radiodays">RADIO DAYS</h2><P class="text-speaker">The 45 King</P><p>I wasn’t pressing up any rap records, because nobody was finishing ‘em. 
You had to have a finished song instead of just a freestyle. 
So I just kept the MC’s off and I really didn’t have too many problems 
[selling records].

his house a few times and kicked some rhymes for him. 
Eventually I met the rest of the original Flavor Unit 
members and we developed a family structure where we 
would all come to 45 King’s house and we would vibe to 
beats.</p><p class="text-speaker">The 45 King</p><p>Red started to play a little demo that I made with Markey Fresh.

forget him.
