Indeed, the seeds of that revolution were already being sown in the West for many years. Metropol was one of the first clubs in this lineage, a decadent space opened in 1978 that was reportedly modeled after Studio 54. In this oral history, Der Klang Der Familie author Sven von Thülen quizzes some of the club’s denizens to tell its story.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the Metropol was the theatre at Nollendorfplatz. The original theatre hall was destroyed in World War II. What later became the Metropol was actually just a little adjacent hall of the theatre, which was so big that it extended across two stories. With a ceiling that seemed like it was 20 metres high.

Former dancer (“the John Travolta of Berlin”) and, later, a resident DJ at influential clubs like UFO and Walfisch

In the 1950s they performed Brecht’s Threepenny Opera there. It then closed down for a while, until it was converted into a porn cinema.
BORIS
When you drove past Nollendorfplatz in the ’70s, you could see the enormous posters. All porn films.
HENRY DE WINTER
Paul Grasse, one of the people who ran the place, looked just like Hitchcock. Honestly. His physiognomy, everything. He was one of the post-war cinema kings in Berlin, and he was the leaseholder of the whole thing.
Mike Klosa
Dancer, disco fanatic and, later, occasional fill-in DJ at Metropol
MIKE KLOSA
I was a real discotheque fanatic back then. I went to The Saint, Paradise Garage, Palladium and Studio 54. I had a look at all of them. When word got around about the Metropol, they said the architects had got tips from the people of Studio 54 and that now a similar plush nightclub was going to open in Berlin. Of course I was all ears. In March 1978 the press started writing about it. Initially they said the opening was meant to be in September. But it only opened at the end of October – with private parties.
HENRY DE WINTER
The porn cinema wasn’t doing that well anymore. The idea of turning it into a discotheque was absolutely brilliant. There was a gallery, various bars on different levels, a wonderful wooden dance floor.
MIKE KLOSA
The music in Berlin’s discotheques was usually pretty commercial up until then. In the run-up to the Metropol opening, they said the music they would play was going to be different, namely disco, space rock and a bit of reggae, all imported from New York. Of course I could hardly wait.
DER WÜRFLER
Through disco, gay nightlife finally shifted into the mainstream focus a bit. It was totally unusual for homos and heteros to party together up until then. I was a dancer in the late ‘70s, the heyday of disco. I even performed with Liza Minnelli, Diana Ross and Gloria Gaynor at Studio 54. It was around that time I started DJing at clubs like Dschungel, Metropol and Cha Cha. Metropol was supposed to be Berlin’s answer to Studio 54.
Boris
Metropol regular and, now, resident DJ at Berghain
BORIS
That part of Schöneberg where the Metropol was located was traditionally a gay area, with lots of bars, speakeasies and nightclubs. Even in the 1920s. So in that respect it fitted in really well.
MARK REEDER
It was Esther Friedmann, Iggy Pop’s girlfriend back then, who told me about the club. She worked there and told me to drop round some time. The first time I went there, I arrived rather late and there wasn’t that much going on anymore. But the sound and the location left a lasting impression on me. From then on I ended up at Metropol almost every weekend.
Douglas Simpson
British soldier stationed in West Berlin and Metropol regular
DOUGLAS SIMPSON
I was with the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Army back then, living in Charlottenburg, sharing a flat with Boris. For some reason I was allowed to live off of camp. One day Boris said to me, “Come on, I will show you this place I like to go to.”
DER WÜRFLER
At first everyone was really sceptical. It made no sense to open such a big club there. It won’t work. Three months later, all the other bars and discotheques in the area were empty. Soon the cosy gay bars where you could sip your liqueur by candlelight were gone, and the transvestite bars also emptied out. One by one, they all moved elsewhere.
DOUGLAS SIMPSON
Being in the military back then, I hadn’t come across many gay people before. Boris was probably the first gay person I’d actually gotten to know well. So being at Metropol was quite the experience. It was before AIDS, too, so you had a lot of heavy-duty stuff going on in the corners.
The first time I walked into the main hall, I was awestruck. It totally blew my mind.
Der Würfler
HENRY DE WINTER
The place took off from day one. Size-wise, there’d not been anything like it in Berlin till then.
DER WÜRFLER
I visited the Metropol for the first time thanks to an invitation. They had a red carpet outside and there was a true frenzy of flashing cameras everywhere. I was pretty impressed.
MIKE KLOSA
Initially it all revolved around glamour. The clientele differed greatly to that of other places, for example to that of Dschungel.
BORIS
Dschungel was where the arty and bohemian crowd went. Although Berlin was already a 24/7 city in those days, the proprietor insisted on closing at 4 AM. I think he always saw it more as a modern cocktail bar rather than a nightclub. The dancefloor was tiny and when the club was full, there were about 200 people there — which was quite a lot by West Berlin standards.
Mark Reeder
Avant-garde impresario, New Order buddy and, by 1990, head of MFS, one of the first trance labels
MARK REEDER
If you didn’t get into the whole avant-garde and punk thing, but didn’t like pop either, you were kinda lost. Metropol offered a platform for people who wanted to dance. The sound system was amazing.
DER WÜRFLER
The first time I walked into the main hall, I was awestruck. It totally blew my mind: laser beams flashing everywhere. I’d never seen anything like it. They came straight at me, as big as fluorescent tubes. And enormous mirrored disco balls everywhere, I think 16 in total, each multiplying the laser beam effects. At the end of the hall, there was a stage that looked like a runway into the sky. They’d suspended a UFO-like construction from the ceiling in front of the stage, which had even more bits and bobs and light show paraphernalia hanging from it, and they could move the whole thing up and down.
